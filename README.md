# Containerised Threat Modelling Tool on AWS ECS Fargate

This repository deploys a **containerised Threat Composer** application on **AWS ECS Fargate** using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code and **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation. The goal is to reproduce a real-world production CI/CD workflow where infrastructure and application are fully automated from Docker build and image push to infrastructure provisioning and secure HTTPS routing.

---

Key highlights:
- Fully automated provisioning with Terraform (remote state in S3 + locking)
- Container images built and pushed to Amazon ECR
- ECS Fargate service fronted by an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with HTTPS using ACM certificates validated via Route 53
- GitHub Actions pipelines for Docker image build/push, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, and `terraform destroy`



## 🏗 Architecture Diagram

![Architecture Diagram](images/architecture.png)

This architecture shows the full end-to-end deployment of the containerised Threat Composer application on AWS. The application is packaged into a Docker container, pushed to Amazon ECR, and deployed to an ECS Fargate service. Incoming traffic is routed securely through an Application Load Balancer (ALB) using HTTPS with an SSL certificate issued by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and validated via Route 53.

All infrastructure components are provisioned using Terraform with remote state stored in S3 and state locking. CI/CD automation is handled through GitHub Actions.


## 🎥 Application Demo

This GIF demonstrates the live deployment of the Threat Composer application running on AWS ECS Fargate, accessed securely through the Application Load Balancer over HTTPS. It showcases the successful end-to-end flow from infrastructure provisioning to application availability.

## ✅ CI/CD Status

Below are the current pipeline statuses demonstrating successful builds and deployments:

## 🔒 Security
The infrastructure follows security best practices:
* Terraform state is stored in an encrypted S3 bucket
* State locking is handled using Terraform's `use_lockfile` feature for local development
* Security groups use least privilege access
* All traffic is encrypted with HTTPS/TLS
* GitHub Actions uses OIDC authentication instead of long-lived credentials


## 💻 Local App Setup

### Option 1: Run Locally with `serve`
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the application
yarn build

# Install 'serve' globally
yarn global add serve

# Serve the built application
serve -s build
```

Visit in your browser:  
```
http://localhost:3000/workspaces/default/dashboard
```

---

### Option 2: Build and Run with Docker
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t threat-composer-app ./app

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 3000:3000 threat-composer-app
```

Then visit:
